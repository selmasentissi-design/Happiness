# Happiness
BA890

The Main Goal is:

     To analyse and visualise relationships between the independent variable (such as Freedom, Health, Corruption etc.) and the Happiness Score in the world. I will also explore the happiness score at different granularities like country or region.
    Identify correlation between independent variables (if any).
    To try and predict which variables impact the most the Happiness Score.
    Combine datasets with Happiness related variables from the years 2015 to 2020 to draw deeper conclusions.

Data Source:

    Data World Happiness Report (https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report).

Motivation:

    Bhutan is a small country in Asia and it introduced the Gross National Happiness (GNP) to the world. Bhutan is also a developing country with a lower income economy which makes you think that a countryâ€™s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is not the only factor that creates happiness within a civilization.
    This research will determine which variables were the most impactful when it comes to countries' happiness scores.
